This is all bash related scripts that I created, will update as necessary

# johntheripper.sh
- Script to install (jumbo) John the Ripper
- Script isn't fully set up correctly as you still have to navigate to the john/run folder to run things but honestly still works if you're working manually at least.
- If you need to run a specific application just navigate to the folder and run the command
-   cd ./john/run
-   ./john <file>
